# YouTube Video Downloader and Uploader

This project is a Python script that searches for a random YouTube video using the [Google YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube), downloads it using the [Pytube library](https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and then uploads it back to YouTube using the [YouTube Upload library](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-upload/).

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Create a project on the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and enable the YouTube API.

3. Download the `client_secret.json` file from the Google Developers Console and place it in the same directory as the script.

4. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal or command prompt.

5. Run the script using `python youtube_uploader.py`.
